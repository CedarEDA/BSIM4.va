BSIM4 PDF issues:

Page 132: "NSD" - "Fatal error if not positive" should be in "Note" column
Page 140: Duplicate "EPSRSUB", second instance should be "EPSRGATE"
Page 142: "EU" - Missing Annotation for binnability
Page 142: "UB" - Typo "secon" -> "second"
Page 152: "CGDL" - Should be "drain region" rather than "source region"
Page 153: Channel-length dependence of `VOFFCV` not `VOFFCVL`?
Page 157: "KF": Missing unit for the `A2-EF` exponent?
Page 157: "KF": `EF` rather than `EFF` in `s` exponent?
Page 160/161: Not using `Â²` superscript like elsewhere in the table
Page 162: "TNJTSSWG/TNJTSSWGD": Missing `D`  on second NJTSSWG
Page 163: "PB" not split up into PBS/PBD like the others
Page 163: Specified `CJSWGD=CJSWS`, but model implements `CJSWGD=CJSWGS`Page 163: Likewise for `MJSWGS`
Page 163: Likewise for `PBSWGS`
Page 166: SA/SB/SC Should maybe have units? `m`?
Page 169: Missing superscripts for exponents in units throughout?

Missing parameters: l, w, ad, as, pd, ps

In the model:
- GEDL current reverse bias should go in the temperature dependent block to avoid per-instance evaluation
- The nsub error message says "is not positive" - "is negative" would be more consistent since the check is `< 0.0`
