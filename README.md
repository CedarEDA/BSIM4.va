# Verilog-A BSIM4

This is a Verilog-A implementation of the BSIM4 model,
hand translated from the original C code. There are
various alternative implementations flying around
on the internet, but unfortunately, they are of
questionable quality and licensing origin and make
poor use of available Verilog-A features. Unfortunately,
that means making our own.

## Current status

Fully translated, not compile checked or validated yet.
